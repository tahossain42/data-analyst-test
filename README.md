# SamKnows Data Analyst Technical Test

Thanks for your application. Here's a short technical test before your interview.

We don't want you to spend any more than an hour on this. If you don't finish everything (especially the `optional` parts) in time, then just send back what you have been able to do with commentary on how you would approach the remainder.

If you've stumbled across this repository and haven't applied for a job at SamKnows:

1. Check http://samknows.com/ to see whether we have any open Data Analyst/Scientist positions.
2. Even if there aren't any jobs currently listed, do this test and send it to us anyway; we're always looking for talented and interested people.
